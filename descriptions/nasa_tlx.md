## Items

Items can go from 1 to 21 (original version), or 0 to 100 for most of modern versions.

- Q1: Mental Demand (MD): How mentally demanding was the task? (Very Low - Very High)
- Q2: Physical Demand (PD): How physically demanding was the task? (Very Low - Very High)
- Q3: Temporal Demand (TD): How hurried or rushed was the pace of the task? (Very Low - Very High)
- Q4: Performance (OP): How successful were you in accomplishing what you were asked to do? (Perfect - Failure)
- Q5: Effort (EF): How hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance? (Very Low - Very High)
- Q6: Frustration (FR): How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed were you? (Very Low - Very High)

## Scoring

As found in: [https://measuringu.com/nasa-tlx/](https://measuringu.com/nasa-tlx/)

*To score, you count the number of lines a participant marked, subtract 1, and multiply by 5. For example, in Figure 1, the score would be 20: (5-1) x 5.*

*If you use a five- or seven-point scale, you can use a coding system similar to the SUS, which transforms the raw responses to map to a hundred-point scale.*
