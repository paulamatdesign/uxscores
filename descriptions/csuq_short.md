Researchers should consider using the PSSUQ/CSUQ when they want a license-free, general measure of perceived usability with known benchmarks.

## Items

From: [https://www.uxtesttools.com/tools/csuq-computer-system-usability-questionnaire#tool](https://www.uxtesttools.com/tools/csuq-computer-system-usability-questionnaire#tool)

The CSUQ consists of 19 standardized statements divided into three dimensions. Users rate each statement on a seven-point Likert scale: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat Disagree, 4 = Neutral, 5 = Somewhat Agree, 6 = Agree, 7 = Strongly Agree.

## Dimensions

From: [https://www.guillaumegronier.com/resources/EchellesUtilisabiliteUX_v1.pdf](https://www.guillaumegronier.com/resources/EchellesUtilisabiliteUX_v1.pdf)

- System Usefulness (SysUse - Items 1 to 8) (1 to 6 in short version)
- Information Quality (InfoQual - Items 9 to 15) (7 to 12 in short version)
- Interface Quality (IntQual - Items 16 to 18) (13 to 15 in short version)
- General Satisfaction (Item 19) (16 in short version)

## Short Version

The short and most used version has 16 items (items 3, 5 and 13 are removed).

## How To

- Group by dimension: System Usefulness, Information Quality, and Interface Quality.
- For each dimension, calculate the mean (between 1 and 7).
- Calculate the overall CSUQ score by averaging all 19 responses.

## Interpret

- More than 5 = high satisfaction.
- Between 4 and 5 = moderate satisfaction.
- Below 4 = low satisfaction.
