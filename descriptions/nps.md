## How to calculate NPS

From: [https://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/measuring-your-net-promoter-score/](https://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/measuring-your-net-promoter-score/)

To calculate your Net Promoter Score (NPS):

Categorize each respondent based on their score, count how many fall into each category:

- Promoters (9–10)
- Passives (7–8)
- Detractors (0–6)

Then calculate the percentage of Promoters and Detractors by dividing each count by the total number of responses and multiplying by 100.

Finally, subtract the percentage of Promoters from the percentage of Detractors using the formula:

NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors.

The NPS score is a percentage that ranges between -100 and 100.
