We encourage everyone to use the theories, methods and tools associated with the Net Promoter System freely to drive sustainable, profitable growth for their businesses. We do, however, require that when they are used, they are properly attributed with registered marks, and that when they are used in the pursuit of a commercial enterprise, they are used under license.

If you use any of our registered marks (on a website, in a brochure, in an article or when publishing your scores), please follow the rules below:

Capitalize all words in the marks, and ensure that you use them accurately. For instance, you should not use NPS Score, as that could be read as "Net Promoter Score Score."
Include a "Registered" symbol (®) or "Service Mark" (SM) after the first use of our registered marks (Net Promoter®, NPS®, NPS Prism®, the individual NPS-related emoticons or the combined emoticon logo, Net Promoter Score℠ and Net Promoter System℠).
Include the attribution language below in a footnote at the bottom of any page that contains a first use of a registered mark. This footnote cannot be smaller than an 8-point font size: "Net Promoter®, NPS®, NPS Prism®, and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., NICE Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. Net Promoter ScoreSM and Net Promoter SystemSM are service marks of Bain & Company, Inc., NICE Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld."

## How to calculate NPS

To calculate your Net Promoter Score (NPS):

Categorize each respondent based on their score, count how many fall into each category:

- Promoters (9–10)
- Passives (7–8)
- Detractors (0–6)

Then calculate the percentage of Promoters and Detractors by dividing each count by the total number of responses and multiplying by 100.

Finally, subtract the percentage of Promoters from the percentage of Detractors using the formula:

NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors.
