To administer the SUPR-Q, users responded to seven of the eight items using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). For one item (“How likely are you to recommend this website to a friend or colleague?”) users respond to an 11-point scale (0 = not at all likely and 10 = extremely likely). The following are the eight items in the SUPR-Q and their corresponding factor:

- The website is easy to use. (usability)
- It is easy to navigate within the website. (usability)
- I feel comfortable purchasing from the website. (trust)
- I feel confident conducting business on the website. (trust)
- How likely are you to recommend this website to a friend or colleague? (loyalty)
- I will likely return to the website in the future. (loyalty)
- I find the website to be attractive. (appearance)
