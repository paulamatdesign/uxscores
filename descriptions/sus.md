# System Usability Scale (SUS)

## About

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a simple, ten-item scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability. It was created by John Brooke in 1986 to be a "quick and dirty", reliable tool for measuring the usability. SUS has become an industry standard, with references in over 1300 articles and publications.

## Items

5-points Likert scales, Strongly disagree to Strongly agree:

- I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
- I found the system unnecessarily complex.
- I thought the system was easy to use.
- I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
- I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
- I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
- I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
- I found the system very cumbersome to use.
- I felt very confident using the system.
- I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

## Themes

- Learnability (items 4 and 10)
- Usability (other items: items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

## Transform

### Compute total SUS score

For odd items: subtract one from the user response.
For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5. This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response).
Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40.

### Compute score by themes

Note: didn’t find official formula to compute learnability and usability. I applied the same protocol but multiplying buy 12.5 for learnability and 3.125 for usability to convert at same range as overall scoring.

## Interpretation

### Interpretation of SUS scores (grades)

- 0-60: F
- 61-70: D
- 71-80: C
- 81-90: B
- 91-100: A

### Interpretation of SUS scores (acceptability)

- 0-50: Not acceptable
- 51-62: Marginal low
- 63-70: Marginal high
- 71-100: Acceptable
