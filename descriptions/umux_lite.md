## Items

5 or 7-points Likert scales, Disagree-Agree:

- Q1: This software capabilities meet my requirements.
- Q2: This software prototype is easy to use.

note: 7-points Likert scales allows to converting to SUS score.

## Transform

### Compute total score

- Items are scored by subtracting one from the user response: [user score - 1]
- Add the two adjusted scores and divide the sum by 12 (the highest possible score).
- Multiply your quotient by 100.
- Average your results across users to score between 0 and 100.

## Interpret

### SUS Correspondance

7-points Likert scales allows to converting to SUS score:

- SUS Predicted = 0.65 * User Score + 22.9
